# Navigator - self managed DBaaS on Kubernetes [![Build Status Widget]][Build Status]

Navigator is a Kubernetes extension for managing common stateful services on
Kubernetes. It is implemented as a custom apiserver that operates behind
[kube-aggregator](https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-aggregator) and introduces
a variety of new Kubernetes resource types.

As a result of this design, managing your services feels as natural as any
other resource in Kubernetes core. This means you can manage fine-grained
permissions via conventional RBAC rules, allowing you to offer popular but
complex services "as a Service" within your organisation.

For more in-depth information and to get started, jump to the [docs](https://navigator-dbaas.readthedocs.io).

Here's a quick demo of creating, scaling and deleting a Cassandra database:

## Supported databases

Whilst we aim to support as many common applications as possible, it does take
a certain level of operational knowledge of the applications in question in
order to develop a pilot. Therefore, we'd like to reach out to others that are
interested in our efforts & would like to see a new application added (or
existing one improved!).

Please search for or create an issue for the application in question you'd like
to see a part of Navigator, and we can begin discussion on implementation &
planning.
